# Loan Payment Calculator

## Notes

- The attached design had a column for "Interest Rate" but the instructions asked for the total interest paid over the course of the loan. I've included both columns.
- I've implemented sorting for the table, since the design looked like the table should be sortable.
- If there was time for it, I would have had a better form validation. I left it out since that wasn't a stated requirement.
- I did not implement any type of front end unit/functional tests for lack of time.
- I would have liked to have a way to clear the Pinia state, but the design didn't account for that.
